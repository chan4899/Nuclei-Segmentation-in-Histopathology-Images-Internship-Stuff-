The task was to review, modify and perform various nuclei segmentation methods by taking inspiration from different segmentation tasks being performed globally and achieve a good AJI score over MoNuseg dataset.

### About MonuSeg dataset:-

The MoNuSeg (Multi-organ Nuclei Segmentation) dataset was obtained by carefully annotating tissue images of several patients with tumors of different organs and who were diagnosed at multiple hospitals. This dataset was created by downloading H&E stained tissue images captured at 40x magnification from TCGA archive. The complete annotation and preprocessing of these H&E images has been done at MeDAL IIT Bombay only.

### Experiment 1:-

we first analysed the method adopted in the paper "Deep advesarial training for multi-organ Nuclei segmentation in Histopathology images".
This paper is heavily based on the GANs for the nuclei segmentation purpose. First of all, to avoid the problem of small size of the data, we first tried to create H&E image-mask pair using Cycle-GAN and randomly generated masks.
Using these artificially generated image-mask pairs, nuclei segmentation is performed using conditional GANs (pix2pix image translation).
The AJI as claimed by the authors over MoNuSeg dataset is 0.721.

### Our Conclusions:-
1) The complete training of the model over MoNuSeg dataset has been performed. The post processing of the results is underway.      As soon as it is done, we can report the AJI obtained for this independent training.
2) As the lot contours in output images are incomplete, background is noisy it needs heavy post processing.
3) According to some other recent papers, conditional GANs (which gives us image to image translation from simple to complex images) canâ€™t be used for the segmentation tasks as segmentation is complex to simple image mapping. The same thing we have discovered here, while implementing this paper.
4) Hence, we moved to a simple end to end supervised network, whose loss function focuses more on the small region occupied by the boundaries.
